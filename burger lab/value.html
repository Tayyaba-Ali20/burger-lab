        <p>As we are aware of the fact that this Global Pandemic has taken us hundreds of years back, thousands of
             lives have been lost, and not just this; anxiety, stress and sorrow have been widely spread as a 
             result of it.</p>
             <p>In these difficult times, Burger Lab wants to promote happiness to all.</p>
             <p>Burger Lab doesn't only provide happiness to its customers but society as a whole. Especially the underprivileged.</p>
             <p>Burger Lab has done drives across orphanages and other establishments such as Dar-Ul-Sukoon and SIUT. We will keep promoting our 
                mission and continue working for the welfare of our society.</p>
